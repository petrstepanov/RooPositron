# positronfit
Positron lifetime fitting software

Program is written in object-oriented C++ using CERN ROOT libraries. Fitting is performed via RooFit package functionality.

Following fitting models are supported:
* Multiexponential
* Trapping model
* Grain boundary model
* Model in liquids accounting on o-Ps oxidation and o-p conversion

Multiple spectra with various channel width can be fitted simultaneously.
